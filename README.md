This tool was developed in Python as a side project to comprehend better how the network adaptations to maximize power transfer between source and load work.

The interface is pretty straight forward. The user inserts the source impedance as well as the load impedance. Then after specifying the frequency and the line impedance, the user chooses between discrete adaptation ( inductors and capacitors ) and continuous adaptation ( using stubs )

The tool was developed in Python 3.9.2, so if you use an older Python version, there may be some conflicts when running the source code.
If the executable is downloaded, mind that the Images folder must be in the same directory as the executable
